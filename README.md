## questions you might have

### should I run your config?

no

### should I copy from your config

do so at your own peril

### why is the file layout so bad

idk what I'm doing and also people keep telling me to use modules but then I point to the modules I use and no one can explain what they mean please help me lmao

### `$THING` broke with your config will you help me?

no but open an issue or reach out anyway if you're gonna be reasonable about it

### why is this repository named `.files` instead of something remotely sensible and usable?

because I hate you and want to make your life a living hell <3
